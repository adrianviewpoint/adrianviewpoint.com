I know we **finally** hear more and more people acknowledge Tesla being more than a car company, with ride sharing robotaxis and the Optimus bot.

One big part of the story that has been developing for years silently is being ignored, energy.

Our grid infrastructure has always been weak worldwide and with the race for AI, electrification of car, etc. Demand for energy will continue to grow.

Well, <a href="https://x.com/search?q=%24TSLA&src=cashtag_click" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$TSLA</a> is also a big player in that space with their Megapacks & the software to manage the flows of the energy.

Remember Elon stating that the energy business will be as big as the car business. Well, it's growing, **rapidly**.

Look at their Q1 from 2023:

And now let's look at how much more of their revenue energy represents 2 years later:

Over time, both business lines will will be eclipsed by robotaxis which will also be eclipsed by the Optimus bot.

All this to say, many reasons to remain bullish on Tesla and the amazing ways they are transforming the world we live in.
